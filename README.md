# validatom

Background to a lighting talk held at Datomic Conference, November 16 2015, Philadelphia.

The example consists of the code on Peer side to create reports and validate datoms.

It also contains a usage examle and utility methods to add the schema in several passes.

The functionality works by having simple local logic for running validatos. It adds some example validators in the schema.edn-file.
